### Back-end Design Decisions

For Problem 1A, there will be an API endpoint named `execute`. The name conveys that we are simply executing the process configuration onto the input configuration. This endpoint would expect a JSON object with `input` and `process` keys and would return a single JSON object with an `output` key.

Again, Problem 1B only requires a single API endpoint named `investigate`. This name conveys the thought that the process configuration needs to be calculated by investigative algorithms and procedures. This endpoint would expect a JSON object with `input` and `output` keys and would return a single JSON object with a `process` key.

Finally, Problem 1C also only requires a single API endpoint named `randomize`. This name conveys that the idea that a input configuration will be randomized by this endpoint. The endpoint would expect a single JSON object with a `input` key and would return a JSON object with an `output` key.
