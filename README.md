# Similkameen Implementation

The Similkameen team decided to implement the entire application using NodeJS. Specifically, React, a modern, front-end library was used with ExpressJS, a popular backend library, was used.

## Operation

When the client is running, a starting configuration can be entered into theinput configuration textbox in the user enrty section. the process configuration can be entered into the process configuration textbox. Both of these values must be in the form of integers separated by spaces. Once both configurations have been entered, press the space button to submit the configurations to the backend and render everything.

## Running

To run, clone this repository, run `yarn` to install the packages, and then run `yarn start`.
